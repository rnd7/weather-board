<b>Terms of Service</b>

The Weather Board, hereinafter referred to as the service, is completely free, non-profit and strictly non-commercial. There is no guaranteed availability and the service might be suspended at any time without prior notification. Especially since it runs on a server in my living room.

It must be assumed that the content is NSFW, discriminatory and of appalling quality. This seems to be what you can expect from human beeings. Cheerio! Fortunately, all entries fade away and are forgotten after one lunar cycle. Nothing remains forever. Keep calm.

Everything you write is public and other users see your cursor position while you are typing. No information is stored by the server that would allow assignment of what has been written by whom.

No user-specific data is collected, no third party services are involved. I don\'t give a f*** about you data. Your IP address is only stored in case of blacklisting after an unusually large number of requests.

Your browser's local storage is used to keep you logged in. To delete all data stored in the browser's local storage by the service click on <b>Logout</b> within the <b>Menu</b>.

There is no moderation or whatever. If you think some content should be deleted, feel free to do so.

Robots are welcome, as long as they well behave.

By pressing <b>Enter</b> on your keyboard or clicking the <b>Confirm</b> button you agree to the Terms of Service and promise not to complain later on.`
